Projet: RayTracer

The raytracing is a technique for rendering three-dimensional graphics,
including many effects like lights, shadows, transparent surfaces etc.
The objective is to determine the color of each light ray that strikes the
screen.


Our project computes basic and advance camera, object tracing to display objects
on the image, ambient and directional lights. Shadowds were not good so we
decided to remove them.

To test it, you have to put in parameter a file with the format .svati:
"./rt <filename>.svati".
It will generate a .ppm file that you can open with "feh <filename>.ppm".

Makefile: 2 rules
- all (the first one): produce the rt binary in the raytracer directory.
- clean: delete everything produced by make
